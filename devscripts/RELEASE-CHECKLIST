0. Run full test suite in all branches. Continue if all tests passed.

1. Run ../prerelease $NEW_TAG.

1a. The script checks out the release branch ('maint' for a bug-fix
    release, 'master' for minor or major release) and calls editor; update
    version, the list of contributors, the list of changes and download
    URL in ANNOUNCE.rst; if it is a stable release - edit docs/news.rst to
    set release date. Edit Version.py and README.rst in the release branch
    - fix versions. Edit section [egg_info] in setup.cfg - set if it is
    a stable or development release. In SetupConfig.py edit "Development
    Status" in trove classifiers; edit dev_tag or download URL: if a
    non-stable version - append 'dev' and date stamp, for a stable
    version remove 'dev' and date stamp). Commit. Verify.

2. Run ../prerelease-tag $NEW_TAG. This checks out the release branch and
   creates the new tag at the head of the release branch. Push the branch
   and the tag to start test/build.

3. Run ../release. This generates and uploads new archives to PyPI.

4. Generate new docs using ./build-all-docs. Upload docs using
   ./publish-docs.

5. Run ../postrelease. The script checks out master and null-merge maint.
   The script restores ANNOUNCE.rst from the previous commit (HEAD~). It
   calls editor; update next version, remove the list of contributors
   and the list of changes, edit download URL in ANNOUNCE.rst. Edit
   docs/news.rst - add new version. Edit Version.py and README.rst - fix
   versions. Edit section [egg_info] in setup.cfg. In SetupConfig.py
   edit "Development Status" in trove classifiers; edit dev_tag or
   download URL. Commit. Verify. Fast-forward next to master.

6. Run ../push-all in the development repository to push all branches
   and tags to the public repositories.

7. Wait until tests finished at AppVeyor. Download generated wheels, put
   them into dist directory and upload to PyPI using twine.

8. Send announcement to the Cheetah mailing list. For a stable release
   send announcements to python and python-announce mailing lists.

9. Announce new release at Wikipedia
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CheetahTemplate).
